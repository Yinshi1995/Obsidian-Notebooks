The default login credentials for MikroTik RouterOS devices are as follows:

- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** (leave it blank)

When you first access a MikroTik router using WinBox or the web-based configuration interface, you typically use these default credentials. It's important to change the default password to enhance security once you have logged in for the first time.
